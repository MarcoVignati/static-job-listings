As i move forward, the next step for this project is creating the filtering system to make it more intuitive. Here's whatâ€™s planned:  

- **Interactive Filters**:  
   - Allowing users to click on tags and instantly filter jobs by `role`, `level`, `languages`, or `tools`.  
   - Supporting multiple filters at once and ensuring the job list updates seamlessly as users interact with the tags.

- **Filter Reset Option**:  
   - Adding a simple way for users to clear all selected filters in one click, making the experience more user-friendly.
